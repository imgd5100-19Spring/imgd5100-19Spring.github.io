# IMGD 5100

## Course Description
IMGD 5100 will discuss interaction through the lens of *immersion*, considering issues of embodiment, creative flow, and user engagement. Assignments in the class will reach across a variety of different mediums to explore user interaction: text-only, audio-only, graphical, and integrated multimodal approaches. Additonal goals include studying fundamental human-computer interaction principles, practicing critique, and exposure to a variety of technologies for interaction and user experience design. A general outline of the course is given below.
